🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning–based pneumonia detection system built using a ResNet50 convolutional neural network trained on chest X-ray images. The model predicts whether pneumonia is present from an uploaded chest X-ray image through an interactive Streamlit web application.

🚀 Features
AI-based chest X-ray classification (Pneumonia / Normal)
Streamlit web interface for easy image upload
Real-time prediction
Educational medical AI demonstration

🧠 Tech Stack
