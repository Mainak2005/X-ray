# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning–based pneumonia detection system built using a ResNet50 convolutional neural network trained on chest X‑ray images. The model predicts whether pneumonia is present from an uploaded chest X‑ray image through an interactive Streamlit web application.

## 🚀 Features

* AI-based chest X-ray classification (Pneumonia / Normal)
* Streamlit web interface for easy image upload
* Real-time prediction
* Educational medical AI demonstration

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras (ResNet50 CNN)
* Streamlit
* NumPy & Pillow

## 📂 Project Structure

* `streamlit_pneumonia_app.py` – Main Streamlit application
* `xray_resnet50_final.h5` – Trained deep learning model
* `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries



## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This application is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not a medical diagnostic tool and should not be used for clinical decision-making. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical advice.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Model performance optimization
* Explainable AI visualization (Grad-CAM)
* Cloud deployment enhancements
* Expanded medical dataset training
